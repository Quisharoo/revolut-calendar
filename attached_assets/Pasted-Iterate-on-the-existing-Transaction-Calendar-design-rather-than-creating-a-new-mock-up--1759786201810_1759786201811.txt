Iterate on the **existing Transaction Calendar design** rather than creating a new mock-up.

---

**Context**
We already have:
- A functioning monthly calendar grid showing day cells.
- Each day cell can display income and expense totals.
- Basic color logic and layout are working.

The goal now is to **improve the interaction and user experience** when a user clicks on a day.

---

**Iteration objectives**

1. **Add side panel interaction**
   - When a user clicks on a day cell, open a **side panel** on the right-hand side of the screen.
   - The panel should:
     - Display the selected date at the top.
     - Include two clearly separated sections:
       - **Income:** list all positive transactions (description + amount).
       - **Expenses:** list all negative transactions (description + amount).
     - Each section should show the subtotal at the top.
   - The panel stays open until the user clicks outside it or a close button.
   - Clicking another day replaces the content with that day’s data (no duplicate panels).

2. **Layout adjustments**
   - Calendar remains visible on the left; panel slides in from the right.
   - On mobile screens, the panel should slide over the calendar as a full-width overlay.
   - Keep transitions smooth (sliding or fading).

3. **Visual and usability refinements**
   - Make the clicked day visually active or highlighted.
   - Ensure income and expense blocks are easily distinguishable (color contrast and spacing).
   - The side panel should feel cohesive with the existing design — same typography, spacing, and color palette.
   - Maintain overall simplicity; don’t introduce new visual styles.

4. **Data behavior**
   - Use existing mock data structure (per day: totals + lists of transactions).
   - Ensure that income and expense lists render dynamically based on the selected date.

5. **Testing the interaction**
   - Verify that clicking a day with no transactions does not open an empty panel.
   - Verify that switching between days updates the panel cleanly without layout shift.

**Goal**
Refine the current prototype by adding the side panel interaction and improving the calendar’s interactivity and feedback.  
Do **not** redesign or replace the existing layout — just iterate and enhance what’s already there to deliver a polished, responsive experience.
