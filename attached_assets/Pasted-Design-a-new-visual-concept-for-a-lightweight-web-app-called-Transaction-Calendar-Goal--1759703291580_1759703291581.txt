Design a new visual concept for a lightweight web app called **Transaction Calendar**.

**Goal:**  
Visualize financial transactions from a CSV file on a clean, modern monthly calendar — similar in layout and tone to the “Subscription Monster” reference design.  
It should feel minimalist, data-driven, and trustworthy — with the same functionality as before, but a refined visual system that works beautifully on both mobile and desktop.

---

**Core functionality (keep exactly the same)**
- Upload or drag-and-drop a CSV file of transactions.  
- Option to “Load Demo Data” to preview sample months instantly.  
- Display a monthly calendar view showing all transactions by day.  
- Color-code transactions by category (Income, Expense, Transfer).  
- Detect recurring transactions and mark them with a loop icon.  
- Provide filters for Category, Broker, Amount range, and Text search.  
- Include a simple insights panel summarizing totals, recurring items, and upcoming charges.

**Visual style and layout**
- **Overall look:** Model it after the “Subscription Monster” example — white background, soft pastel accent colors, airy grid, two-column structure, generous padding, and calm typography.  
- **Left section:** Full calendar grid with subtle lines, rounded day cells, and small transaction cards inside each cell.  
- **Right section:** Sidebar summary for the current month — showing total spend, income vs expense, projected vs actual, and category filters with color dots.  
- **Navigation:** Clean top bar with app name/logo on the left, simple nav items (Calendar, List, Accounts), and a user avatar on the right.  
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif (Inter or SF Pro), high readability, medium weight for headings.  
- **Colors:**  
  - Background – off-white (#FAFAFB)  
  - Cards – white (#FFFFFF) with soft shadow or 1 px border  
  - Text – dark gray for primary, muted gray for secondary  
  - Income – Green / Teal accent  
  - Expense – Soft Red accent  
  - Transfer – Neutral Gray  
  - Category tags – gentle pastel tints (10–15% opacity of accent)  
- **Micro-interactions:** Hover lift on cards, smooth transitions between months, pill-style view toggles (Calendar/List), active filters highlighted with color.

**Responsiveness**
- Must be **mobile-first**, but scale elegantly to tablet and desktop.  
- On mobile:  
  - Use a simplified calendar view (scrollable day cards or condensed grid).  
  - Filters and insights open as bottom sheets.  
  - Navigation collapses into a top hamburger or minimal icon bar.  
- On desktop:  
  - Show full two-column layout (calendar + sidebar) with plenty of white space.  
  - Persistent filters on the right side.  
- All components share one design system — same colors, icons, and spacing — simply reflowed by screen width.

**Output**
Produce high-fidelity screens that include:
1. Upload/Import screen with “Load Demo Data” option.  
2. Populated monthly calendar view (Subscription Monster style).  
3. Sidebar summary and category filter panel.  
4. Mobile version of the same experience (condensed but visually consistent).

The goal is a cohesive, production-ready concept — calm, analytical, and responsive.
