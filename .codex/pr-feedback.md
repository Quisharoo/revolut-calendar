- **chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]** (commented): Posted Codex automation notice (no action).

## Inline Review Comments
1. **RangeSummaryDrawer.tsx**: Drop the fallback to `largestTransaction.broker` and rely solely on `source?.name`, or otherwise justify mixed source usage.
2. **CalendarGrid.tsx**: Pointer guard should explicitly limit left-button mouse drags while still allowing touch; current condition is logically flawed.
3. **CalendarDayCell.tsx**: Mirror the pointer guard fix applied to CalendarGrid.
4. **CalendarGrid.tsx (P1)**: `event.preventDefault()` on touch `pointerdown` blocks native scrolling; adjust so touch interactions can still scroll unless a drag selection is actually underway.

## Issue Comments / Other Notes
- **Vercel bot**: Deployment notification only.

Action items: address the four inline comments; no other required changes identified.
