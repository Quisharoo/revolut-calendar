Speckit Engineering Constitution

Principles
1. Code Quality First
   - Maintain readable, modular, and well-documented codebases.
   - Prefer clear design patterns and consistent coding standards over ad hoc solutions.
   - Require peer review for every change touching production paths.
2. Test with Purpose
   - Mandate automated tests that validate expected behavior and guard against regressions.
   - Define coverage expectations per component; investigate gaps before release.
   - Preserve fast, reliable pipelines; failing or flaky tests block merges until resolved.
3. User Experience Consistency
   - Align implementations with established UX patterns, accessibility guidelines, and copy tone.
   - Validate user flows across supported devices and locales prior to launch.
   - Favor predictable interactions over novel but inconsistent behavior.
4. Performance as a Feature
   - Budget performance metrics (latency, memory, throughput) during planning.
   - Profile critical paths and remediate bottlenecks before shipping.
   - Track performance regressions in telemetry; treat degradations as release blockers.

Governance
1. Decision Framework
   - Use these principles as the default lens for technical trade-offs and prioritization.
   - Document architecture and implementation decisions in design records that reference the applicable principle(s).
   - Escalate deviations to the engineering leads with justification rooted in measurable impact.
2. Implementation Standards
   - Embed principle checklists into code review templates and definition-of-done criteria.
   - Require sign-off from Quality, UX, and Performance representatives for launches that materially affect their domains.
   - Maintain living playbooks for onboarding, testing, UX, and performance to operationalize these principles.
3. Continuous Stewardship
   - Run quarterly principle retrospectives to assess adherence and adjust guidance.
   - Audit representative projects biannually to verify that decisions reflect the constitution.
   - Empower every engineer to flag misalignments; unresolved concerns escalate to the Architecture Council.
